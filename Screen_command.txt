10 Screen Command Examples to Manage Linux Terminals

Screen is a full-screen software program that can be used to multiplexes a physical console between several processes (typically interactive shells). It offers a user to open several separate terminal instances inside a one single terminal window manager.

The screen application is very useful, if you are dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface and for separating programs from the terminal shell. It also allows you to share your sessions with others users and detach/attach terminal sessions.

# apt-get install screen (On Debian based Systems)

Start screen for the first time

Just type screen at the command prompt. Then the screen will show with interface exactly as the command prompt.

pungki@mint ~ $ screen

Show screen parameter

Type “Ctrl-A” and “?” without quotes. Then you will see all commands or parameters on screen.

To get out of the help screen, you can press “space-bar” button or “Enter“. (Please note that all shortcuts which use “Ctrl-A” is done without quotes).

Re-attach the screen

pungki@mint ~ $ screen -r

Use screen -ls to see how many screen are available.

pungki@mint ~ $ screen -ls

Switching between screens

When you do nested screen, you can switch between screen using command “Ctrl-A” and “n“. It will be move to the next screen. When you need to go to the previous screen, just press “Ctrl-A” and “p“.

To create a new screen window, just press “Ctrl-A” and “c“.

Leaving Screen

There are 2 (two) ways to leaving the screen. First, we are using “Ctrl-A” and “d” to detach the screen. Second, we can use the exit command to terminating screen. You also can use “Ctrl-A” and “K” to kill the screen.

That’s some of screen usage on daily basis. There are still a lot of features inside the screen command. You may see screen man page for more detail.
